The online payment and guarantee system allows the Shipowner to pay the funds to the platform first, and then inform the platform to release the money to the Supplier after the service is satisfied. On one aspect, the Shipowner can obtain satisfactory services, and on the other aspect, the Supplier can receive the payment after the service is completed to solve the problem of trust. 

The credit evaluation system allows shipowners and suppliers to provide evaluations to each other after the service is completed, and urges both parties to continually improve their credit levels on the basis of honesty and trustworthiness to obtain more trading opportunities.
